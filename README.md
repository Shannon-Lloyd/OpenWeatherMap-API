Data Analysis Bootcamp API Challenge
# Matplotlib Challenge 
Assignment for UT Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp to practice using APIs, JSON and the geoViews Python library in Jupyter Lab to collect data and present it in an visually effective manner to understand the data and communicate in a way that is engaging.

## About
Use OpenWeatherMap API to gather data about locations around the world. Create and Manipulate Pandas DataFrames and charts with Matplotlib to find relations between weather and latitudes of locations. Use geoViews to plot the data from the first half of this challenge on a world map. Use Geoapify API to find hotels near places that meet your preferred weather conditions. Plot those locations on a map so we can visualize where our preferred weather conditions are located and hover over the location to see information about that location with the name of a hotel at that location. 

## Getting Started

You will need to create a file called api_keys containing valid api keys for both OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify first.

All other necessary files are located in this python-api-challenge repository. 

The python-api-challenge folder contains the files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb.

Output from WeatherPy.ipynb is sent to cities.csv within the output folder in python-api-challenge repository. 

Run WeatherPy.ipynb first since the results of it are saved to an output file that are then used in VacationPy.ipynb.


## Installing
This was run using gitbash on a Windows 10 Pro system.
Jupyter Lab and Pandas
Python 3.10.11
conda 23.5.0


## Usage
Initiate gitbash on the matplotlib-challenge folder.  
Enter "conda activate dev" into gitbash to initiate a dev environment.
Enter "jupyter lab" to open Jupyter Lab at the python-api-challenge folder.

Make sure you create the apy_keys.py file and save valid keys for OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify!!!!! 

After making sure you have working api keys placed correctly, open and run WeatherPy.ipynb.

The final output data will be saved to the output_data folder in the cities.csv file.

Then open and run VacationPy.ipynb.


## Contributing
Thank you to CG:AF at Central Grading for refering me to https://community.codenewbie.org/kwing25/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-project-16ej. I have used this as a template instead of the template from the Gitlab repository for class.

https://apidocs.geoapify.com/ was necessary to complete this assignment.

https://openweathermap.org/current was necessary to complete this assignment.

https://hvplot.holoviz.org/source was difficult but necessary.

In class activities was the code that I used the most.
